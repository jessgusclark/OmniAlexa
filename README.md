## Contribute

Please hold off on contributing until the code has one more refactoring. I’d like to make it so the tasks are called dynamically based on the event in addition to splitting up the tasks and the API calls. Once that is completed I’ll add a document with instructions on how to contribute and code style. From there, contributions will be welcomed!
